I'm Yunan Zhang, studying Computer Science and Statistics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm interested in machine learning, and relevant tasks in computer visions, natural language processing and data mining.  Previously, I've done research in network mining and visual-semantic embedding, and I'm still interested in relevant topics. Recently, I focus on QA tasks as well as Meta RL.
