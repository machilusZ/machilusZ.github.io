I'm Yunan Zhang, studying Computer Science and Statistics at The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests lie in the general area of NLP and IR, particularly in structured knowledge representations and reinforcement learning as well as their applications in sequential decision making and machine reasoning.
