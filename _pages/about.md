I'm Yunan Zhang, a MSCS student at UIUC. My research interests lie in the general area of NLP and IR, particularly in how to enable machines to learn languages and knowledge in a human-like way, so that our intelligent systems can conduct memorization, retrieval, reasoning, and interaction for more genearl and efficient task-solving.
